"""Validation: the hard gates that separate edge from noise.

The full pipeline is:
    1. walk_forward_evaluate(...)         — honest out-of-sample performance
    2. combinatorial_purged_cv(...)       — robustness across overlapping splits
    3. deflated_sharpe(...)               — penalize the Sharpe for multiple-testing

If a strategy passes all three, it's worth a paper-trade slot. If it fails any,
it's killed before it costs real money. The deflated_sharpe gate has no
override — that's the whole point.
