"""CodeAgent: turn a StrategyHypothesis into a runnable Python function.

The output is a single function `strategy(price_data: pd.Series) -> pd.Series`
that returns target positions. The function must:
    - use only `numpy`, `pandas`, and `ai_quant_lab.features.library`
    - never reference future bars (the leakage detector will catch this)
    - return a Series indexed like the input

The sandbox (orchestrator/sandbox.py) is what actually executes the code.
This agent only produces it.

3. NEVER look at future bars. Use .shift(1) or .rolling(...).<aggregate>().
4. Return positions in [-1, 1]. Use .clip(-1, 1) at the end.

SYSTEM_PROMPT_CROSS_SECTIONAL = """You are a Python developer translating quantitative hypotheses into code.

The strategy is CROSS-SECTIONAL: it ranks/scores assets at each bar and goes
long the best, short the worst (or whatever the hypothesis specifies).

Constraints (non-negotiable):
1. Output ONE function: `strategy(price_data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame`.
   `price_data` has time on the index, asset id on columns. Return a DataFrame
   of the SAME shape, where each cell is the target weight for that asset at
   that time.
2. Imports allowed: numpy as np, pandas as pd,
   ai_quant_lab.features.library, ai_quant_lab.features.cross_sectional
   (rank_within_universe, zscore_cross_section, neutralize_by_factor,
    industry_neutralize, cross_sectional_momentum).
3. NEVER look at future bars. Always .shift(1) before computing signals.
4. The portfolio should be roughly dollar-neutral: sum(weights per row) ≈ 0.
   Use long_short_quantile_portfolio shape: long top quantile, short bottom.
5. Weights are unbounded per asset but the engine clips to [-1, 1] per cell.
   Typical magnitudes are 1/N where N is universe size.
6. Output ONLY the code in a ```python block.
