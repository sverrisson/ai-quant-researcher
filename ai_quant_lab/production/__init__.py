"""Production: the layer between accepted strategies and real money.

The work here is paranoia, not cleverness:
    - LiveDiagnostic checks every day whether the strategy looks like its
      backtest (Sharpe, hit rate, drawdown). If not, flag it.
    - KillSwitch shuts everything down when a hard rule trips.
    - DecisionLog records every order with enough context to audit later.

This module is intentionally lightweight. Production trading needs a broker
integration, position reconciliation, and operational discipline we don't
provide here. What we DO provide is the diagnostic skeleton you can plug
those things into.
